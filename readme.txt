- To know the rules of writing the OSM data, I got help from this wiki : http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features

- In most part of codes, I got basic parts from Udacity's Data Wrangling course.

- To write readme, I refered this site : https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2

- To create tables in SQL, I used the schema in this site : https://gist.github.com/swwelch/f1144229848b407e0a5d13fcb7fbbd6f
